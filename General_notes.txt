Exiting robotframework has support for wiremock. And has many library support. And opensource. So choosed this framework.

If we are ok to go with Licensed tool,
we can go with Swagger - if the swagger api is provided, automatically test cases can be generated out.
Or use postman to create testcase using given swagger api 

Circle CI integration:
======================
Have not worked with circle CI. But knew the procedure that should be followed for CI/CD integration

The steps currently we follow in Bamboo:
1. Do a git clone of the repo
2. Do a docker build using the command in the README file
3. Do a docker save of the created image using
         $ docker save -o <tar file name> <dockerrepository>:<dockertag>
         eg:
         $ docker save -o typicode.tar typicode_tc:1.0
4. The created tar will be uploaded to bamboo server and be available to all.
5. So anyone can download the tar (pre built image) and do docker load
         $ docker load -i <tar file name> 
         eg:
         $ docker load -i typicode.tar
6. Check the loaded image using "docker images" command
7. Run the container with loaded docker image.
